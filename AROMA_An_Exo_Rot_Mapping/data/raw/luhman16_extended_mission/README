Hi Daniel & Fuda,

It is fantastic! Light curves are ready! I attach them to the mail. If you 
have no more the lightcurve we used for the paper, you can find it by 
using the PATHOS webpage https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/pathos

Each light curve is in the same format used for the old one: 
col 1: BTJD (BJD-2457000.0)
col 2: it is the barycentric correction already applied to the col 1, 
anyway in this case is zero because I had no time to extract this 
(useless) information
col 3: is the PSF-fitting RAW photometry flux
col 4: is col 3, CORRECTED for CBV
col 5: is the 1-px aperture photometry RAW flux
col 6: is the 1-px aperture photometry CORRECTED flux 
... and so on for col 7-12 for 2-px, 3-px, 4-px aperture photometry
col 13 is the local sky background
col 14 and 15 are the X/Y positions on the CCD
col 16 is the DQUALITY flag. The good points have DQUALITY==0

As done for the first work, the best photometries are the PSF-fitting and 
the 1-px photometry. Remember to normalize the flux to its median/mean and 
to use the corrected photometries (so, cols 3 or 5).
Some tips to "clean" the light curve: exclude for sure all the points with 
DQUALITY>0. Then, I usually do a cut on the background, excluding all the 
points with sky>mean_sky+4sigma and all the points with sky>200 or 250 e/s 
(it depends on how faint is the star...maybe in this case it's better 200 
as threshold) . That's all. Let me know if something is not clear.

Last info: light curves are both in ascii and fits formats. In their 
headers you can find any information on the observations and on the star. 
The file name contains itself information on the sector (36 or 37), tic 
number, etc.
